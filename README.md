# nft-function-test
Repo forked from jsartoolkit5 to test AR functionalities
To test if an NFT can render a 3D model, go to examples folder. In the examples folder, there are multiple NFT batches (same name but with extensions of iset, fset3, fset)
in the DataNFT folder. Then, open the nft_threejs_wasm.html file within the examples folder and on line 84 you can change the name of the extension after 'DataNFT' to a file 
in the examples. Do NOT add the extension of any of the files within the "DataNFT" files. 

If you wish to use your own NFT, go to https://carnaux.github.io/NFT-Marker-Creator/#/ and upload an image. 

Once you go live with the server/open in pages via github, you can then use the picture form of the files and show it in front of the camera. If it doesn't work initially, try pushing the image
closer to the camera to test further.
